# Inference {#infer}

+ Standard errors and sampling distribution via randomization
    + Developing traditional inference from randomization
    + two-sample permutation test -> null distribution  
    + Showing what happens when assumptions/conditions arenâ€™t met
    + Then show normal/t-test and show how it fits on top of sampling distribution
+ Hypothesis testing
    + The theory of hypothesis. Criminal justice. Question: what do you do with a problem like alpha?
+ Confidence intervals
+ Simple linear regression
+ Multiple regression
    + Regression/correlation/multiple regression/confounding
    + Categorical predictor and baseline 
    + Implement `tidy`, `broom::augment`, and `glance` in `broom` package to get results
    + Model selection is a can of worms 
    + Cross-validation
        + Take half of dataset for fit, use to predict other half.
            + Show random sampling of half matters
            + Is only once enough?


## Topics to be Dropped

* Design of experiments
* statistical power
* Independence/Probability
* Chi-Square Tests
* Not do extensive ANOVA, but allude to it after doing multiple regression with categorical
* Logistic Regression
* CLT/Mathematical computation engine (but we need to ascertain the unintended consequences of dropping it)
    + Tell them the minimum they need to know
