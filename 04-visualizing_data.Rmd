Theoretical discussion of the grammar of graphics
  - Menard example
  
Five named graphs
  - Breakdown of their components with geoms
  - Jenny Bryan / [Naomi Robbins](https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Effective-Graphs-Naomi-Robbins/dp/0985911123?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0)

  + scatterplot: jitter/alpha
  + linegraph:
  + mosaicplot (write mosaicplot in ggplot)
  + Need a way to track all issues/FAQ's
