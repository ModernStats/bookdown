In Chapter \@ref(tidy), we discussed the importance of datasets being **tidy**.  You will see in examples here why having a tidy dataset helps us immensely with plotting our data.  We will focus on using Hadley's `ggplot2` package in doing so, which was developed to work specifically on datasets that are **tidy**.  It provides an easy way to customize your plots and is based on data visualization theory given in _The Grammar of Graphics_ [@wilkinson2005].

Graphics provide a nice way for us to get a sense for how quantitative variables compare in terms of their center and their spread.  It also helps us to identify patterns and outliers in our data.  We will see that a common extension of these ideas is to compare the distribution (i.e., what the spread of a variable looks like) as we go across the levels of a different categorical variable.

## Five Named Graphs - The FNG

<!--
* Focussing on `dep_delay` here and how it relates with other variables
* May need to introduce some data manipulation here with `dplyr`
* Restrict types of plots:
    + histogram: as long as we avoid density plots
    + boxplot: have to set x=1 aes. categorical variables when univariate
        - Hadley suggests that a univariate boxplot shouldn't be used and prefers a histogram <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ggplot2/N4qRSmqMZxI>
        - Boxplots do make sense when comparing distributions across levels of another variable though
    + barplot: issue with categorical variables 
        - May want to also discuss dot plots for many levels of categorical variable
    + scatterplot: jitter/alpha/color
    + linegraph: useful for time series / not useful if no ordering to x-values
    + faceting: show why better than stacked bargraphs in via patterns across levels
    + mosaicplot [I actually prefer side-by-side bar graphs/facetted bargraphs to stacked/mosaic so this might be moot?]
-->

For our purposes here, we will be working with five different types of graphs.  (Note that we will use a lot of different words here in regards to plotting -  "graphs", "plots", and "charts" are all ways to discuss a resulting graphic.  You can think of them as all being synonyms.)  These five plots are:

- histograms
- boxplots
- barplots
- scatter-plots
- line-graphs

With this toolbox of plots, you can visualize just about any type of variable thrown at you.  We will discuss some other variations of these but with the FNG in your repertoire you can do big things!  Something we will also stress here is that certain plots only work for categorical/logical variables and others only for quantitative variables.  You'll want to quiz yourself often on which plot makes sense with a given problem set-up.

We now introduce another dataframe in the `nycflights13` package introduced in Chapter \@ref(tidy).

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
data(weather)
```

## Histograms

Our focus now turns to the `temp` variable in this `weather` dataset.  We would like to visualize what the  `r nrow(weather)` temperatures look like.  Looking over the `weather` dataset^[To view a dataset in spreadsheet format in RStudio, you can run the `View()` function with the dataframe as its argument.] and running `?weather`, we can see that the `temp` variable corresponds to hourly temperature (in Fahrenheit) recordings at weather stations near airports in New York City. We could just produce points where each of the different values appears on something similar to a number line:

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Strip Plot of Hourly Temperature Recordings from NYC in 2013"}
hist_title <- "Histogram of Hourly Temperature Recordings from NYC in 2013"
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp, y = factor("A"))) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_blank())
```

This gives us a general idea of how the values of `temp` differ.  We see that temperatures vary from around `r round(min(weather$temp, na.rm = TRUE), 0)` up to `r round(max(weather$temp, na.rm = TRUE), 0)` degrees Fahrenheit.  The area between 40 and 60 degrees appears to have more points plotted than outside that range.

What is commonly produced instead of this strip plot is a plot known as a **histogram**.  The **histogram** show how many elements of the variable fall in specified **bins**.  These **bins** may correspond to between 0-10&deg;F, 10-20&deg;F, etc.

To produce a histogram, we introduce the Hadley's `ggplot2` package [@R-ggplot2].  We will use the `ggplot` function which expects at a bare minimal as arguments

- the dataframe where the variables exist and
- the names of the variables to be plotted.

The names of the variables will be entered into the `aes` function as arguments where `aes` stands for "aesthetics".

```{r}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp))
```

The plot given above is not a histogram, but the output does show us a bit of what is going on with `ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp))`.  It is producing a backdrop onto which we will "paint" elements.  

We next proceed by adding a layer---hence, the use of the `+` symbol---to the plot to produce a histogram.  (Note also here that we don't have to specify the `data = ` and `mapping = ` text in our function calls.  This is covered in more detail in Appendix A - Chapter \@ref(appendix1).)

```{r fig.cap=hist_title}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

We have the power to specify how many bins we would like to put the data into as an argument in the `geom_histogram` function.  By default, this is chosen to be 30 somewhat arbitrarily and we have received a warning above our plot that this was done.  We also notice here that another warning about 1 missing value is given.  This value is omitted from the plot. This warning is ignored for future customizations of the plot. (**Discuss missing values here?**)


```{r fig.cap=paste(hist_title, "- 60 Bins"), warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 60)
```

We can tweak the plot a little more by specifying the width of the bins (instead of how many bins to divide the variable into) by using the `binwidth` argument in the `geom_histogram` function.  We can also add some color to the plot by invoking the `fill` and `color` arguments.  A listing of all of the built-in colors to R by name and color is available [here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf).


```{r fig.cap=paste(hist_title, "- Binwidth = 10"), warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, color = "white", fill = "forestgreen")
```


```{block lc4-1, type='learncheck'}
**_Learning check_**

**4.1** What does changing the number of bins from 30 to 60 tell us about the distribution of temperatures?

**4.2** Would you classify the distribution of temperatures as symmetric or skewed?

**4.3** What would you guess is the "center" value in this distribution?  Why did you make that choice?

**4.4** Is this data spread out greatly from the center or is it close?  Why?
```


### Continuous data summaries

The `temp` variable is a **continuous** quantitative variable (frequently just called a **continuous variable**).  "A variable is **continuous** if you can arrange its values in order and an infinite number of unique values can exist between any two values of the variable"[@r4ds2016].  Some common examples of continuous variables are time and height.  Between any two times there are an infinitely many number of time units that fall between them.  

It is often easier to think about quantitative variables that are not continuous to help us better understand continuity.  The best example is counts.  If we are looking to count the number of flights that depart on a given day from New York City, this variable would not be continuous.  It falls on a **discrete** scale.

We can examine some summary information about this `temp` variable.  To do so, we introduce the `summary` function.  (We will see in Chapter \@ref(manip) how to use the `summarize` function in the `dplyr` package to produce similar results.)

The syntax here is a little different than what we have seen before.  (A further discussion about R syntax is available in Appendix A - Chapter \@ref(appendix1)). Here `summary` is the function and it is expecting an object to be summarized as its argument.  The object here is the `temp` variable in the `weather` dataframe.  To focus on just this one variable `temp` in `weather`, we separate them by the dollar sign symbol `$`.  Order matters here:  the dataframe comes before the `$` and the variable/column name comes after.

```{r}
summary(weather$temp)
```

This tells us what is known as the **five-number summary** for our variable as well as the **mean** value of the variable.  More information on both of these concepts is given in Appendix A - Chapter \@ref(appendix1).

This `summary` gives us some numerical summaries of our temperature variable.  The minimum recorded temperature is `r min(weather$temp, na.rm=TRUE)` degrees Fahrenheit and the maximum is `r max(weather$temp, na.rm=TRUE)` degrees Fahrenheit.  We have one missing value denoted as an `NA` in the observations of this variable.  The median Fahrenheit temperature of `r median(weather$temp, na.rm = TRUE)` and mean of `r mean(weather$temp, na.rm = TRUE)` are quite close.  This is a property of symmetric distributions.  

The last two entries given by `summary` correspond to the 25^th^ percentile and the 75^th^ percentile.  If we sorted all of the temperatures in increasing order, we would see that 25% of them would fall below `r (q1 <- quantile(weather$temp, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE))` and that 75% of them would fall below `r (q3 <- quantile(weather$temp, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE))`.  This implies that the middle 50% of data values lie between `r q1` and `r q3` degrees Fahrenheit.

**Introduce standard deviation here?**

### Summary

Histograms provide a useful way of looking at how ONE continuous variable varies.  They allow us to answer questions such as

- Are there values far away from the center?  These are commonly called **outliers** and can frequently be easily identified on a histogram. 
- Are most values close to the center?  If so, the spread of the variable is small.  If not, the spread is large.
- How spread out are the values?  One measure of this spread is **standard deviation** discussed above.

The histogram show how many entries fall in different groupings of this variable.  Another common property of distributions is symmetry and as we saw it is quite easily identified by looking over the histogram produced from the variable's values.

## Boxplots


Histograms can also be produced to compare the distribution of a variable over another variable.  Suppose we were
interested in looking at how the temperature recordings we saw in the last section varied by month.  This is what is meant by "the distribution of a variable over another variable".

### Facetting

In order to look at histograms of `temp` for each month, we introduce a new concept called **facetting**.  Faceting is used when we'd like to create small multiples of the same plot over a different categorical variable.  By default, all of the small multiples will have the same vertical axis.  An example will help here.  We will discuss the concept of faceting in further detail in Section \@ref{barplots}.

```{r warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = "white", fill = "firebrick") +
  facet_wrap(~month)
```

As we might expect, the temperature tends to increase as summer approaches and then decrease as winter approaches.

```{block lc4-2, type='learncheck'}
**_Learning check_**

**4.5** What other things do you notice about the faceted plot above?  How does a faceted plot help us see how relationships
between two variables?

**4.6** What do the numbers 1-12 correspond to in the plot above?  What about 25, 50, 75, 100?

**4.7** What could be done to make the faceted plot above more readable?  (Focus on tweaking the histograms and not on making a 
different type of plot here.)

**4.8** For which types of datasets would these types of faceted plots not work well in comparing relationships between variables?
Draw or give an example.
```

Histograms can provide a way to compare distributions across groups as we see above when we looked at temperature over months.  Frequently,
a plot called a **boxplot** (also called a **side-by-side boxplot**) is done instead.  The **boxplot** uses the information provided in the **five-number summary** referred to in the previous section when we used the `summary` function.  It gives a way to compare this summary information across the different levels of a group.  Let's create a boxplot to compare the monthly temperatures as we did above with the faceted histograms.

```{r}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = month, y = temp)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Note the first warning that is given here.  (The second one corresponds to missing values in the dataframe and it is turned off on subsequent plots.) This plot does not look like what we were expecting.  We were expecting to see the distribution of
temperatures for each month (so 12 different boxplots).  This gives us the overall boxplot without any other groupings.  We can get around this by introducing a new function for our `x` variable.

```{r warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = factor(month), y = temp)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```


We have introduced a new function called `factor()` here.  One of the things this function does is to convert a numeric value like `month` (1, 2, ..., 12) into a categorical variable.  The "box" part of this plot represents the 25^th^ percentile, the median (50^th^ percentile), and the 75^th^ percentile.  The dots correspond to **outliers**.  (The specific formulation for these outliers is discussed in Appendix A - Chapter \@ref(appendix1).)  The lines show how the data varies that is not in the center 50% defined by the first and third quantiles.  Longer lines correspond to more variability and shorter lines correspond to less variability.

```{block lc4-2b, type='learncheck'}
**_Learning check_**

**4.9** What does the dot at the bottom of the plot for May correspond to?  Explain what might have occurred in May to produce this point.

**4.10** Which months have the highest variability in temperature?  What reasons do you think this is?

**4.11** We looked at the distribution of a continuous variable over a categorical variable here with this boxplot.  Why can't we look at the distribution of one continuous variable over the distribution of another continuous variable?  Say temperature across pressure, for example?

**4.12** Boxplots provide a simple way to identify outliers.  Why may outliers be easier to identify when looking at a boxplot instead of a faceted histogram?
```

### Summary

Boxplots provide a way to compare and contrast the distribution of ONE quantitative variable across multiple levels of ONE categorical variable.  One can easily look to see where the median falls across the different groups by looking at the center line in the box.  You can also see how spread out the variable is across the different groups by looking at the width of the box and also how far out the lines stretch from the box.  Lastly, outliers are even more easily identified when looking at a boxplot than when looking at a histogram.

## Barplots

Both histograms and boxplots represent ways to visualize the variability of continuous variables.  Another common task is to present the distribution of a categorical variable.  This is a simpler task since we will be interested in how many elements from our data fall into the different categories of the categorical variable.  We need not bin the data or identify the different quantiles for categorical variables.

Frequently, the best way to visualize these different counts (also known as **frequencies**) is via a barplot.  Consider the distribution of airlines that flew out of New York City in 2013.  This can be plotted by invoking the `geom_bar` function in `ggplot2`:

```{r, fig.cap="Number of flights departing NYC in 2013 by airline"}
ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier)) +
  geom_bar()
```

Recall the `airlines` dataset discussed in Chapter \@ref(tidy).

```{r}
library(knitr)
data(airlines)
kable(airlines)
```

We see that United Air Lines, JetBlue Airways, and ExpressJet Airlines had the most flights depart New York City in 2013.  To get the actual number of flights by each airline we can use the `table` function on the `carrier` variable in `flights`:

```{r}
flights_table <- table(flights$carrier)
flights_table
```

More information on the use of this `$` syntax is available in Chapter \@ref(tidy) and in Appendix A - Chapter \@ref(appendix1).

We can sort this table from highest to lowest counts by using the `sort` function:

```{r}
sorted_flights <- sort(flights_table, decreasing = TRUE)
names(sorted_flights)
```

It is often preferred for barplots to be ordered corresponding to the heights of the bars.  This allows the reader to more easily compare the ordering of different airlines in terms of departed flights [@robbins2013].  We can also much more easily answer questions like "How many airlines have more departing flights than Southwest Airlines?".

We can use the sorted table giving the number of flights defined as `sorted_flights` to **reorder** the `carrier`.

```{r, fig.cap="Number of flights departing NYC in 2013 by airline - Descending numbers"}
ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = names(sorted_flights))
```

The last addition here specifies the values of the horizontal `x` axis on a discrete scale to correspond to those given by the entries of `sorted_flights`.

**4.13** Why are histograms inappropriate for visualizing categorical variables?

**4.14** Why are three specific questions that can be more easily answered by looking at Figure 4.6 instead of Figure 4.5?

**4.15** How many Envoy Air flights departed NYC in 2013?

**4.16** What was the seventh highest airline in terms of departed flights from NYC in 2013?
```

### Must avoid pie charts!

Unfortunately, one of the most common plots seen today for categorical data is the pie chart.  While they may see harmless enough, they actually present a problem in that humans are unable to judge angles well.  As Naomi Robbins describes in her book "Creating More Effective Graphs", we overestimate angles greater than 90 degrees and we underestimate angles less than 90 degrees.  In other words, it is difficult for us to determine relative size of one piece of the pie compared to another.

Let's examine our previous barplot example on the number of flights departing NYC by airline.  This time we will use a pie chart.  As you review this chart, try to identify 

- how much larger the portion of the pie is for ExpressJet Airlines (`EV`)  compared to US Airways (`US`), 
- what the third largest carrier is in terms of departing flights, and
- how many carriers have fewer flights than United Airlines (`UA`)?


```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(flights, aes(x = factor(1), fill = carrier)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), 
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

While it is quite easy to look back at the barplot to get the answer to these questions, it's quite difficult to get the answers correct when looking at the pie graph.  Barplots can always present the information in a way that is easier for the eye to determine relative position.  

There may be one exception from Nathan Yau at FlowingData.com[^https://flowingdata.com/2008/09/19/pie-i-have-eaten-and-pie-i-have-not-eaten/] but we will leave this for the reader to decide:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/Pie-I-have-Eaten.jpg")
```

```{block lc4-3b, type='learncheck'}
**_Learning check_**

**4.17** Why should pie charts be avoided and replaced by barplots?

**4.18** What is your opinion as to why pie charts continue to be used?
```

### Using barplots to compare two variables

Barplots are the go-to way to visualize the frequency of different categories of a categorical variable.  They make it easy to order the counts and to compare one group's frequency to another.  Another use of barplots (unfortunately, sometimes inappropriately and confusingly) is to compare two categorical variables together.  Let's examine the distribution of outgoing flights from NYC by `carrier` and `airport`.

We begin by getting the names of the airports in NYC that were included in the `flights` dataset.  Remember from Chapter \@ref(tidy) that this can be done by using the `inner_join` function in the `dplyr` package.

```{r}
flights_namedports <- inner_join(flights, airports, by = c("origin" = "faa"))
str(flights_namedports)
```

We see that `name` now corresponds to the name of the airport as referenced by the `origin` variable.  We will now plot `carrier` as the horizontal variable.  When we specifiy `geom_bar`, it will specify `count` as being the vertical variable.  A new addition here is `fill = name`.  Look over what was produced from the plot to get an idea of what this argument gives.

```{r, fig.cap="Stacked barplot comparing the number of flights by carrier and airport"}
ggplot(data = flights_namedports, mapping = aes(x = carrier, fill = name)) +
  geom_bar()
```

This plot is what is known as a **stacked barplot**.  While simple to make, it often leads to many problems.

```{block lc4-3c, type='learncheck'}
**_Learning check_**

**4.19** What kinds of questions are not easily answered by looking at the above figure?

**4.20** What can you say, if anything, about the relationship between airline and airport in NYC in 2013 in regards to the number of departing flights?
```

Another variation on the **stacked barplot** is the **side-by-side barplot**.

```{r, fig.cap="Side-by-side barplot comparing the number of flights by carrier and airport"}
ggplot(data = flights_namedports, mapping = aes(x = carrier, fill = name)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

```{block lc4-3d, type='learncheck'}
**_Learning check_**

**4.21** Why might the side-by-side barplot be preferable to a stacked barplot in this case?

**4.22** What are the disadvantages of using a side-by-side barplot, in general?
```

Lastly, an often preferred type of barplot is the **faceted barplot**.  We already saw this concept of faceting and small multiples in Section \@ref(facetting).  This gives us a nicer way to compare the distributions across both `carrier` and airport/`name`.

```{r, fig.cap="Faceted barplot comparing the number of flights by carrier and airport"}
ggplot(data = flights_namedports, mapping = aes(x = carrier, fill = name)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_grid(name ~ .)
```

Note how the `facet_grid` function arguments are written here.  We are wanting the names of the airports vertically and the `carrier` listed horizontally.  These sorts of _formulas_ are in `y ~ x` order.  We will see more examples of this in Chapter \@ref(infer).


```{block lc4-3e, type='learncheck'}
**_Learning check_**

**4.23** Why is the faceted barplot preferred to the side-by-side and stacked barplots in this case?

**4.24** What information about the different carriers at different airports is more easily seen in the faceted barplot?
```

### Summary

Barplots are the preferred way of displaying categorical variables.  They are easy-to-understand and to make comparisons across groups of a categorical variable.  When dealing with more than one categorical variable, faceted barplots are frequently preferred over side-by-side or stacked barplots.  Stacked barplots are sometimes nice to look at, but it is quite difficult to compare across the levels since the sizes of the bars are all of different sizes.  Side-by-side barplots can provide an improvement on this, but the issue about comparing across groups still must be dealt with.
