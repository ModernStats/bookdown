# Manipulating Data {#manip}

- Going through a lot of examples with `dplyr` here
    + Definitely want to introduce them to the pipe
    + Show why it is so much better than nesting/temporary variables
- Make sure to refer back to plots in the viz chapter and how the
  material here relates to answering those questions
- We'll also need to address how this leads into inference
