# Manipulating Data {#manip}

- Going through a lot of examples with `dplyr` here
    + Definitely want to introduce them to the pipe
    + Show why it is so much better than nesting/temporary variables
    + Show how to get the summary statistics mentioned in Viz across 
      groups with `group_by` and `summarize`
    + Show how to rename variables such as the `name` column from `airlines`
    + Get number of elements in specific columns similar to `table()` function
      with `dplyr`
    + [Nick Horton's slides from JSM](https://github.com/Amherst-Statistics)
- Database normalization
   + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization
   + Add importance of joining tables
- Make sure to refer back to plots in the viz chapter and how the
  material here relates to answering those questions
- We'll also need to address how this leads into inference
