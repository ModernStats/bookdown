# Concluding Remarks {#conclusion}

If you've come to this point in the book, I'd suspect that you know a thing or two about how to work with data in R.  You've also gained a lot of knowledge about how to use simulation techniques to determine statistical significance.  The hope is that you've come to appreciate data manipulation, tidy data sets, and the power of statistical visualization.  Actually, the data visualization part may be the most important thing here.  If you can create truly beautiful graphics that display information in ways that the reader can clearly decipher, you've picked up a great skill.  Let's hope that that skill keeps you creating great stories with data into the near and far distant future.  Thanks for coming along for the ride as we dove into modern data analysis using R!

## Topics to be Dropped

* Design of experiments
* statistical power
* Independence/Probability
* Chi-Square Tests
* Not do extensive ANOVA, but allude to it after doing multiple regression with categorical
* Logistic Regression
* CLT/Mathematical computation engine (but we need to ascertain the unintended consequences of dropping it)
    + Tell them the minimum they need to know
* Simpson's paradox
