# Visualizing Data {#viz}

Cover grammar of graphics?  Yes, we definitely should.

Theoretical discussion of the grammar of graphics
  - Menard example
  
Five named graphs
  - Breakdown of their components with geoms
  - Jenny Bryan / [Naomi Robbins](https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Effective-Graphs-Naomi-Robbins/dp/0985911123?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0)
  - In particular histogram as a visual representation of distribution. i.e. it is an empirical distribution as an estimate of population distribution.


## Five Named Graphs. FNG

Restrict types of plots:
  + histogram: as long as we avoid density plots
  + boxplot: have to set x=1 aes. categorical variables
  + barplot: issue with categorical variables
  + scatterplot: jitter/alpha
  + linegraph:
  + mosaicplot (write mosaicplot in ggplot) [I actually prefer side-by-side bar graphs/facetted to stacked so this might be moot?]
  + Need a way to track all issues/FAQ's
