+ Idea of histogram of sample being a visual approximation to population distribution.
    + Shiny
    + Take normal distribution using mean/SD of okcupid heights and plot count (not density) 
    curve on top of histogram.
+ Sampling distribution:
    + Permutation test:
        * Flight delays for American vs United
        * Do women smoke more than men in OkCupid? 
        * Think up more dichotomies than male vs female.
        * 


+ Standard errors and sampling distribution via randomization
    + Developing traditional inference from randomization
    + two-sample permutation test -> null distribution  
    + Showing what happens when assumptions/conditions arenâ€™t met
    + Then show normal/t-test and show how it fits on top of sampling distribution
    + Shiny Google Forms
