## Correlation is not causation

+ Observational study vs randomized experiment (fit with correlation)
    + flights is an observational study
+ Correlation is not causation
    + Confounding variables
    + Shoes on vs waking up with headache
    
## Simple linear regression

+ Implement `tidy`, `augment`, and `glance` in `broom` package to get results
    
## Multiple linear regression {#mlr}

+ Regression/correlation/multiple regression/confounding

## Types of predictors   

+ Categorical predictor and baseline 
    
## Advanced topics

+ Model selection is a can of worms 
+ Cross-validation
    + Take half of dataset for fit, use to predict other half.
    + Show random sampling of half matters
    + Is only once enough?
