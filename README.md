## To-do

- Change colors of Learning check/Review Question blocks as needed
    + Need to match colors in preamble.tex too
- See if way to automate numbering of Learning check questions
    + Currently an issue with https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/issues/152
    + Need to specify both CSS and LaTeX environment code for custom blocks
- Remove hard-coding whenever possible

### Down the road

- Parameterize the chapters so that other examples could be plugged in easily
   + Will need to set up `ifelse` conditions for the text to make sense in some spots
